Originally programmed by Atari in 1972. Features two
paddles, controlled by players, with the goal of getting
the ball past your opponent's edge. First to 10 points wins.

# Credits

Much of the code here comes from CS50's Intro to Game development course.

I've added a simple AI for Player 2 and also added touch controls for
use on mobile.
